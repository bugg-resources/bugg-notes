# Thumb Screws
Ordered thumbscrews and captive washers.
Changed from black oxide to self coloured to save a few quid.

They're out of stock - lead time 14-28 days. Oh well.

I considered using the 8mm ones rather than 10mm, but they don't work (I have one on my desk, by incredible luck) - they jam, because the stupid threaded captive washer stays on the threaded portion and works as a lock nut.
