Topped up Â£10 from my Monad card. I think that gives me 8GB of data.
Tested in phone, works.
I only get 4G+ (?) at my house, despite the coverage map indicating that I should have 5G.

Speed test:
In my bedroom I get 40Mbits, 3Mbits up, terrible latency.

Vodafone speed is much worse (6Mbits), latency about the same

Got another EE sim. Number 07498829311
To top up, call 150. Registered with pin 7917
