# Internal Microphone / LED Board Assembly
- [ ] Mate FFC into connector on LED board. Ensure FFC is inserted fully, is inserted straight, and the the metal contacts are upwards when viewed from the LED side.
- [ ] Mate the microphone board onto the LED board with the board-to-board connectors
- [ ] Screw the two boards together with M3 machine screw qty 2 per BOM
- [ ] Microphone / LED board assembly is complete.
# Lid Assembly
- [x] Ream lightpipe holes out to 2.6 H7
- [x] Press in lightpipes qty 3
- [x] Press in threaded inserts qty 6
- [ ] Affix acoustic membrane over microphone hole. Ensure it is centred within the shallow circular recess. Exercise extreme care to not compromise the bond with contaminants by 1) Wearing nitrile gloves 2) Peeling the membrane carefully from its carrier film with fine tweezers, grabbing it only at the outer periphery so that there is plenty of untouched surface area to form the bond 3) Not touching the adhesive surface, even with gloves 4) Discarding any membranes that are dropped or soiled.
- [ ] Glue indicating silica gel sachet to lid ceiling with adhesive Bostik Glu Dot 10mm
- [ ] Affix GSM anttenna to lid wall opposite door opening. 
- [ ] Tape down flying antenna lead at solder joint with Kapton tape to provide some strain relief. 
- [ ] Install M12 cable assembly as follows: 1) Remove nut 2) Ensure O-ring is present on M12 connector 2) Carefully fold wires at a right angle at the wire-to-board connector and thread it through the housing wall. Be careful to not apply high force to the wires as it is possible to pull them out of the connector housing. 3) Orient the M12 connector with its mating key downwards 4) Thread the nut over the cable and screw onto the connector. 5) Tighten nut with spanner or box spanner.
- [ ] Screw Microphone / LED board assembly into the lid with self tapping screw qty 2 per BOM. Note the locating pegs seat.
- [ ] Lid assembly is complete.
# Door Assembly
- [ ] Fit thumbscrews qty 2 with threaded washers qty 2. Ensure threaded washer passes all the way over the threaded portion of the screw, and is free to spin on the shank.
- [ ] Door assembly is complete
# Main Board Assembly
- [ ] Mate CM4 onto mezzanine connectors. Make sure to apply even pressure so that the connectors mate vertically and together, rather than one-by-one or in a rocking motion
- [ ] Retain CM4 with M2.5 machine screw qty 4
- [ ] Insert CR1220 coin cell
- [ ] Main board assembly is complete
# Base Assembly
- [ ] Screw Main Board Assembly to base with self tapping screw qty 4 per BOM. Note screw pattern is not symmetric.
- [ ] Base assembly is complete

# Product Assembly
- [ ] Bring together Lid Assy and Base Asssy
- [ ] Mate FFC onto base board. Ensure it is not twisted, and the metal contacts are visible when looking at the top side of the main board with the CM4
- [ ] Mate U.FL antenna connector onto base board. These can be tricky - ensure part is mated properly by rotating the connector by "dragging" it gently by the wire light light radial force.
- [ ] Mate the M12 cable assembly's wire-to-board connector to the main board. Listen for a positive "click" sound.
- [ ] Mate the lid and base housing halves together, being careful to not trap any wires, particularly the delicate RF cable.
- [ ] Screw the housing together with M3 machine screws qty 4.
- [ ] Insert SD card
- [ ] Insert SIM card
- [ ] Screw door assembly into place.
- [ ] Product assembly is complete
